# Kanata configuration file
Here lies the configuration for using the Caps Lock key as:
- The Esc key on tap
- The Left Control key on hold

## Changing delays
You can change the delay for the key identification as esc or as lctrl, changing the numbers after `tap-hold`. The first one is for the esc identifier and the second one is for the lctrl identifier.

## Daemon configuration
Put the service file in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory.
